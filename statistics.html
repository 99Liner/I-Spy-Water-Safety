                    <p>Our interactive game is designed not just for fun, but also for learning. The statistics below demonstrate the effectiveness of the game in teaching players about lake water safety. 
                        Each dot represents a player's performance, with the number of scenarios correctly handled on the vertical axis and the time taken to complete the game on the horizontal axis.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>First Playthrough</h3>
                <p>In the initial round of gameplay, players are often getting acquainted with the game mechanics and lake safety rules. 
                    The scatter in the "First Playthrough" graph represents the learning curve as players begin to understand the importance of making safe choices. 
                    While the spread is broad, indicating varying levels of initial knowledge, there's a general trend that suggests players improve as they continue playing.</p>

                <h3>Second Playthrough</h3>
